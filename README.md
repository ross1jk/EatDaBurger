# EatDaBurger

# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

### Important

* **This assignment must be deployed.** Be sure to utilize the [MYSQL Heroku Deployment Guide](../../04-Important/MySQLHerokuDeploymentProcess.pdf) in order to deploy your assignment.

### Before You Begin

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](https://youtu.be/msvdn95x9OM).

### Submission on BCS

## Instructions

7. Require the following npm packages inside of the server.js file:
   * express

#### View setup

1. Inside your `burger` directory, create a folder named `views`.

   * Create the `index.handlebars` file inside `views` directory.

   * Create the `layouts` directory inside `views` directory.

     * Create the `main.handlebars` file inside `layouts` directory.

     * Setup the `main.handlebars` file so it's able to be used by Handlebars.

     * Setup the `index.handlebars` to have the template that Handlebars can render onto.

     * Create a button in `index.handlebars` that will submit the user input into the database.

#### Directory structure

```
